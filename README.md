 The HTML code in the image is the starting structure of a fun web-based game called ‚ÄúTHE THENGA SHAM.‚Äù It begins by setting up the document type and language, followed by meta tags to ensure proper character encoding and mobile responsiveness. The page title is set to appear as "THE THENGA SHAM" in the browser tab. A custom playful font called ‚ÄúChewy‚Äù is imported from Google Fonts to style the text. Basic CSS styling is applied to ensure consistent layout using box-sizing, remove default margins, hide scrollbars, and apply a light yellow background. Additionally, a background video element (#bgVideo) is styled to cover the entire screen using fixed positioning and full width and height, suggesting a visually engaging design.

This part of the CSS code defines the core user interface elements of the game. The #gameContainer is initially hidden using display: none, likely until the game starts. The .coconut class styles the coconut image or element that appears when clicked‚Äîit is positioned absolutely, hidden at first with opacity: 0 and scale(0), and then animated into view using a custom animation called popIn. This animation smoothly scales the coconut up and fades it in, giving a ‚Äúpopping‚Äù effect. The #counter element, which likely shows the total number of coconuts clicked, is styled to appear fixed at the top-left corner of the screen with padding, a semi-transparent white background, and rounded corners for a clean, visible display.

This JavaScript code controls the main interactive logic of the game. It listens for clicks anywhere on the document. When the user clicks, it checks if the click is not on the reset button or a hidden area, then updates the coconut count‚Äîup to a preset limit. Each valid click creates a new coconut element (div) with an emoji (ü••) and places it visually at the position of the click using the cursor‚Äôs coordinates. These coconuts are then added to the screen. Once the user reaches the coconut limit, a message is displayed. The reset button has its own click listener, which resets the count to 0, removes all existing coconuts from the screen, and hides the message‚Äîeffectively restarting the game. This part demonstrates dynamic DOM manipulation, event handling, and user feedback in an interactive web experience.

The video demonstrates a simple interactive web game called ‚ÄúThe Thenga Sham,‚Äù where users click on a coconut image . Each click updates the ‚ÄúTotal Coconuts‚Äù count on the screen. The game showcases basic web development concepts like event handling, dynamic content updates, and playful user interface design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
